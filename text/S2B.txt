The enemy forces lie dead as a platoon of 34 Guardsmen arrives to help you.
He recognizes you as an elite Karskin of the Cadian Shock Troopers.

	'Karskin.' He greets your salute. He motioned for you to be at ease and begin to question you on your current directive.
You told him that it was your squadâ€™s original mission to clear a jammer located in a tower southeast of here.
Unfortunately, it was ambushed midway, leaving you as the only survivor.

'I see. I am Second Lieutenant Daidh Kraftwerk of the 56th Cadian.
My unit and I were ordered to reach this location as a vanguard unit,
clearing ways for the rest of my battalion, but as I reached this place our Vox was jammed and contact was lost,'
the Lieutenant said, frowning, 'It will be a good idea to clear that jamming signal then before we do anything else.
You are with us now Karskin.'(Type in the number of the choice)
