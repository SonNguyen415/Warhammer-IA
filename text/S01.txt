'FOR THE EMPEROR!!!!!'

The sounds of holy fury could be heard in the distance as thousands of artillery pieces bombarded the planet.
Across Hive Kulpino one could see millions upon millions of Imperial Guardsmen,
ready to die in the name of the Holy God-Emperor.
In this vast battlefield, your squad had already been killed and you are the last man standing.

BOOOM

An explosion knocked out the building next to you as you hid beneath the rubble,
ahead you could see a squad of the rebel forces. What will you do? (Type in the number of the choice)
